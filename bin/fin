if test -h = "$*" -o --help = "$*"
then
  cat <<HELPSCREEN | sed 's/^..//'
  Usage: fin file [command]

  Runs the command, with the file set to standard input.
  If no command is given, it defaults to \`cat\`

  It's nice to be able to do:
    $ cat somefile
    $ cat somefile | someprocess

  The "correct" way is annoying, because you can't just append to your previous command:
    $ cat somefile
    $ someprocess < somefile

  This is what fin is for:
    $ fin somefile
    $ fin somefile someprocess
HELPSCREEN
  exit 0
fi


filename="$1"
shift
test -z "$*" && set cat
exec "$@" < "$filename"
