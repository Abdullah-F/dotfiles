# Keybindings:
#   C-] <char>   search forward for the char
#   M-C-] <char> search backward for the char
#   C-@          set mark
#   C-x C-x      exchange point and mark (point is where the cursor is)
#   M-*          complete with all expansions inline
#   M-{          same as M-*, but uses brace expansion
#   M-$          complete variable
#
# Ruby:
#   Ruby programs that use readline come in as "ruby"
#   Not super useful :/ I assume it's because of this line
#   https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/917bc68772e447c9fe7f86ee1588e13771b992b6/ext/readline/readline.c#L1893
#   Might not be hard to add a method which changes that variable
#
#   ```
#   $if Ruby
#     set visible-stats on
#   $endif
#   ```
#
# Introspection in Bash:
#   Primary interface seems to be the `bind` function
#   bind -v   # list variables, like what we set above
#   bind -p   # print existing keybindings
#   bind -l   # list functions you can bind keys to
